# Design Consideration for Educational Apps

By [*Frasier Spiers*](http://www.speirs.org)

## Misc

- The best way to predict the future is to teach the children who will go there.
- Citizens of 22nd century are now here.
- More technology in 2035 vs 2013?
- iPad has been successful as a creativity device rather than a textbook.
- Ideal school computer. Kids can take the device with them everywhere. 98% of tasks can be done on iPad.

## Don'ts and Dos for Developers

### Don'ts

- Don't assume the internet works correctly. Schools sometimes ban the internet for kids. If it works, don't assume the bandwidth is fast.
- Don't rely on your own personal memory of school. New things have changed education.
- Don't use In-App Purchase. No Vpp. Alternative is to have both a paid and freemium version.
- Don't assume users can read. They might be too young.
- Don't use push notification as an advertising channel.
- Don't assume there are only one or two other devices nearby.
- Don't give children land mines with IAPs, externals limits, etc. Keep them in the app.
- Don't lock them into your cloud service.
- Don't depend on YouTube. It's frequently blocked.
- Don't depend on FaceBook. It's banned in many schools due to bullying, etc.
- Don't beg for stars or reviews with popups.
- Don't assume we speak with an American accent. Apps that use voice.
- Don't get too difficult to soon. Build up to gradual answers.
- Don't assume iPad minis. Minis are too small for kids with limited motor skills.
- Don't require shaking the device.
- Don't use sexual entendres or connotations.
- If you show ads, be age-appropriate.
- Don't be creepy with user data. Be careful with location services.
- Don't wrap your PDF and call it a textbook.

### Dos

- Be fun to use. Give children frequent wins to build confidence.
- Talk to teachers.
- Test with actual children.
- Different countries and regions have different curricula.
- Prioritize stability over features.
- Be power-efficient.
- Provide a guide for teachers and parents.
- Support the Photos app. It's at the heart of many school iPad workflows.
- Support email export of files. Support on-device conversion to PDF. Don't go overboard with too many formats.
- Support sharing. AirDrop.
- Support Google Drive as well as Dropbox. Lots of free space on Google Drive.
- Think about the social aspect. Ex. Toca Boca: social collaboration between kids on the same devices.
- Think about motivational strategies.
- Be tamper-evident. Penalize random tapping.
- Provide structure with headroom for creativity.
- Support a range of skill levels.
- Record and playback user activity support.
- Consider localization even if your app is country-specific.
- Support projectors and Airplay. AppleTV is big in schools.
- What can you do with iBeacon? Automatic registration, Treasure hunts.
- Do interesting things with AirDrop. Document sharing, picture sharing.

# Indie

By [*Daniel Pasco*](https://twitter.com/dlpasco)

## What is Indie

- Supports company with contract work, with the ability to make and sell their own apps.
- Support yourself with your own craft, not under someone else's controls.
- Use money as a means to make great things.

## Why be Indie

- Inability to be funded by investors.
- Rather be free but poor, not the other way around.
- Poor fit for investors. "We make apps" -> investors don't like this.
- Freedom - ability to call the shots. Don' try to exploit employees.
- Freedom fighters - create the place they want to work, the products they want to build.
- Indies can transform industries. They can also create them.

## Challenges

- Money
- Responsibility - Liable for everything.
- Risk - stress
- Employees - extra money, risk and responsibility.

## Notes from the trenches

- "If you are gonna be a wolf, get more wolves".
- Client work will never go away. It's a good source of income. It keeps you sharp even though you aren't making your own products.
- Product work will never go away either. It's fulfilling and showcases your work. Additional revenue stream. A passive marketing tool, and recruiting tool.
- OODA Loop - observe, orient, decide, act
- Develop a business model - fixed costs + expenses
- Big guns are not always as good in the long run as junior devs who have potential.
- If it was easy, everyone would do it.

# Zen and the Art of Quitting your Job

*By Ashe Dryden* [@ashedryden](https://twitter.com/ashedryden)

## Questions for Yourself

- Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance book mention.
- What would happen if you were fired today?
- What would you work on?
- Who would you be with?
- If you could work anywhere, where would you work?

## Why Quit?

- Better for relationships and social life.
- Better for your health. Reduced stress.
- Better for your career and skills.

## Why are you thinking about quitting?

- 80% of people are dissatisfied with jobs.
- You might feel stuck.
- You might have low work/life balance.
- Burnout: years of lac of interest
- Apathy: don't care about product. No opinions on things. Cynical.
- No creativity, no passion. Coding is a chore.
- This leads to unhappiness + laziness. Late for work. Smiling is rare.
- You can't be yourself at work - feel excluded.
- Lack of growth and challenge. Solving the exact same problems over + over again. (Consulting is like this for some.)
- Money + benefits - Where was last vacation. Bad health insurance.
- High stress: heart disease + lots of other problems.
- It's killing us as developers. It's killing our creativity.

## Preparing to Quit

- Make some lists.
- Expenses for living. Reduce them!
- Stock up on: food, savings, emergency fund, nice clothes for job interviews.
- What I need: people to spend time with, hobbies to get back into.
- What I want out of life: If the next 5 years are the last 5 years of your life, what would I do?

## It's Time

- Quit: but take some time off first.
- Don't get too worried about finding a position you might not want.
- Add structure to time off. Exercise + rest.
- Gain perspective on your past: what was it about your job or you that was causing problems.
- Help some humans: find someone new and teach them something. Teach kids to make apps.
- Meet people outside of tech.
- Rekindle your passion. Learn something outside of your comfort zone. Attend meetups for skills you've never tried.
- Distinguish yourself. Blog about yourself. Tell people about yourself at meetups.

## Now What?

- Don't settle - What do you want from work?
- What things should a job have for you to enjoy it.
- What should you be getting paid? Add 25% to that!!!
- What about the work environment: social workplace environment.
- Dream big: What is the company you most want to work for?
- Be proud of your work. Work somewhere where they are proud of you and your work.
- Interview the company. What is special. How do they deal with disagreements. How many meetings. Conference budget. Talk to people you might be working with. Do you like them. How often do you need to work weekends or evenings. How about deadlines? What is your least favorite thing about your job.
- Take your time. Live frugally. Talk it over with your family.

## Passion

- "Find the place that you will give everything too."
