# Design Consideration for Educational Apps

By [*Frasier Spiers*](http://www.speirs.org)

## Misc

- The best way to predict the future is to teach the children who will go there.
- Citizens of 22nd century are now here.
- More technology in 2035 vs 2013?
- iPad has been successful as a creativity device rather than a textbook.
- Ideal school computer. Kids can take the device with them everywhere. 98% of tasks can be done on iPad.

## Don'ts and Dos for Developers

### Don'ts

- Don't assume the internet works correctly. Schools sometimes ban the internet for kids. If it works, don't assume the bandwidth is fast.
- Don't rely on your own personal memory of school. New things have changed education.
- Don't use In-App Purchase. No Vpp. Alternative is to have both a paid and freemium version.
- Don't assume users can read. They might be too young.
- Don't use push notification as an advertising channel.
- Don't assume there are only one or two other devices nearby.
- Don't give children land mines with IAPs, externals limits, etc. Keep them in the app.
- Don't lock them into your cloud service.
- Don't depend on YouTube. It's frequently blocked.
- Don't depend on FaceBook. It's banned in many schools due to bullying, etc.
- Don't beg for stars or reviews with popups.
- Don't assume we speak with an American accent. Apps that use voice.
- Don't get too difficult to soon. Build up to gradual answers.
- Don't assume iPad minis. Minis are too small for kids with limited motor skills.
- Don't require shaking the device.
- Don't use sexual entendres or connotations.
- If you show ads, be age-appropriate.
- Don't be creepy with user data. Be careful with location services.
- Don't wrap your PDF and call it a textbook.

### Dos

- Be fun to use. Give children frequent wins to build confidence.
- Talk to teachers.
- Test with actual children.
- Different countries and regions have different curricula.
- Prioritize stability over features.
- Be power-efficient.
- Provide a guide for teachers and parents.
- Support the Photos app. It's at the heart of many school iPad workflows.
- Support email export of files. Support on-device conversion to PDF. Don't go overboard with too many formats.
- Support sharing. AirDrop.
- Support Google Drive as well as Dropbox. Lots of free space on Google Drive.
- Think about the social aspect. Ex. Toca Boca: social collaboration between kids on the same devices.
- Think about motivational strategies.
- Be tamper-evident. Penalize random tapping.
- Provide structure with headroom for creativity.
- Support a range of skill levels.
- Record and playback user activity support.
- Consider localization even if your app is country-specific.
- Support projectors and Airplay. AppleTV is big in schools.
- What can you do with iBeacon? Automatic registration, Treasure hunts.
- Do interesting things with AirDrop. Document sharing, picture sharing.

# Indie

By [*Daniel Pasco*](https://twitter.com/dlpasco)

## What is Indie

- Supports company with contract work, with the ability to make and sell their own apps.
- Support yourself with your own craft, not under someone else's controls.
- Use money as a means to make great things.

## Why be Indie

- Inability to be funded by investors.
- Rather be free but poor, not the other way around.
- Poor fit for investors. "We make apps" -> investors don't like this.
- Freedom - ability to call the shots. Don' try to exploit employees.
- Freedom fighters - create the place they want to work, the products they want to build.
- Indies can transform industries. They can also create them.

## Challenges

- Money
- Responsibility - Liable for everything.
- Risk - stress
- Employees - extra money, risk and responsibility.

## Notes from the trenches

- "If you are gonna be a wolf, get more wolves".
- Client work will never go away. It's a good source of income. It keeps you sharp even though you aren't making your own products.
- Product work will never go away either. It's fulfilling and showcases your work. Additional revenue stream. A passive marketing tool, and recruiting tool.
- OODA Loop - observe, orient, decide, act
- Develop a business model - fixed costs + expenses
- Big guns are not always as good in the long run as junior devs who have potential.
- If it was easy, everyone would do it.
