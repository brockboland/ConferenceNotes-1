### Flow

*By Georgia Dow* [@Georgia_Dow](https://twitter.com/Georgia_Dow)

- Use psychology to make apps even better.
- Mentions "Flow" book.
- Fully immersed in an activity - A feeling of spontaneous joy.
- Where do you find flow? When you have balanced your skill level with the task at hand.
- Too low of a challenge level can lead to boredom. Too high can lead to overwhelming feeling.
- Apps with too many features or confusing interface.
- Benefits of flow
    - Websites - more user engagement
    - Apps - feel more comfortable and intuitive
    - Jobs - with flow work longer and get sick less often.
- Criteria for flow
    - Clear goals - when we feel lost we feel incompetent
    - Intense and focused concentration in the present moment
    - A loss of self-consciousness
    - Balance between skill and challenge - Careful of the pacing of information towards the user (not too fast or slow)
    - Timelessness. Being so engrossed in the present you lose track of time.
    - Experience of the activity itself is intrinsically rewarding. "Autotelic Experience"
    - Immediate feedback
        - Slow, laggy apps can be frustrating
        - Can use sound cues, animation, responsiveness to help with this.
    - Knowing that you can succeed - Tutorials
- Testing flow in your app
    - watch people while using the app (watch their level of engagement)
    - "Flow Likert Scale"
- Things that disrupt flow in apps
    - too many choices
    - unusual interface
    - deep navigation
    - popup ads that come up in the middle of doing something
    - jarring sounds
    - lag
    - jittery movements
    - app updates with major ui changes
- Things that keep you using an application or website
    - achievement
    - productivity savings
    - feeling of enjoyment
    - new content
    - easy to consume information
- How well do *you* Flow?

### The Great Pretender

*By Pieter Omvlee* [@pieteromvlee](https://twitter.com/pieteromvlee)

- Pretend to be more than an "indie"
- Too many devs are focused on building "consumer" software
- Adopt more of a business-like approach to everything we do
- Common things to be wary of:
    - "Scratch your own itch" - valid but careful of typical crowded markets (rss readers, podcast apps)
    - "A good app will sell itself" - Millions of apps in the app store. The actual chances of this are slim.
    - "User experience is your business plan" - An actual business plan is a vital thing. User experience answers none of this.
    - "The death of indies. App Store restrictions. It's Apple's fault!" - Too simple. Apple can't be blamed for everything.
        - Slide listing issues in the App Store.
        - Don't wait for apple to fix these problems.
- We are trying to sell to the wrong market. Be more focused on serving more pro-level users.
- We are not providing enough value to customers. So can't extract enough value.
- Professional users - they have a need and they have money to spend.
- Pretend to them
    - Act with more confidence, professionalism, trustworthiness than the typical indie dev 
    - Instill confidence in customers.
    - Charge more!
    - Have a polished web site.
- Pretend to yourself - Aim Higher
    - Every day ask yourself, "What should I be doing today to increase my bottom line?" It may not involve coding!
    - Calculate the income you need per year to become indie.
    - Look at other platforms besides Apple.
    - "The first step to becoming big is to pretend to be that."

### Motivation

*By Rob Rhyne* [@capttaco](https://twitter.com/capttaco)

- "It's too hard for indies to make money on the app store"
    - No. "Should be it's hard for indies to make money"
- "People don't value software"
    - No. "People value what they can see"
    - Build a product that is compelling and provides value.
    - Marketing won't save you.
    - Pricing will not save you.
- Make decisions for yourself
    - Boyd's decision cycle
        - observation
        - orientation
        - decision
        - action
- First steps
    - collect data on what *you can measure*
    - analyze data based on *your mental* understanding
- Scientific method
    - observation
    - analysis
    - hypothesis
    - test & validate
- Science the $&%# out of your business!
    - The purpose of any business: Make Money!
    - Cash flow gives you a picture. A function of expenses and revenue. What is the cost of you revenue?
    - How do you measure cash flow?
        - Determine billing cycle - Net 30
        - Cash accounting < Accrual based accounting (based on what you invoice) - Accrual accounting is easier to understand - Only issue is end of year numbers. Reflects cost-per-dollar-earned.
    - Use Profit/Loss statements
    - Use Balance Sheet
    - If you're not growing, you are shrinking! Manage expenses!
    - How do you measure growth?
        - Lookback charts. Catch and analyze plateaued growth as soon as you can. Expenses tend to creep up in this situation.
        - Peaks and valleys. There be dragons!
            - Create a separate savings account for the business! 3-6 months operating costs. Caveat: This is not practical for a very large company.
            - Accrued revenue (you invoiced but haven't collected) - blessing and a curse.
    - Don't rely 100% on your accountant for business fundamentals.
    - Accelerants
        - build your assets - understand your margins - Contracting margins are constrained. Margins for products can be exponential. Risk matches reward for the contracting/product scenario.
        - Opportunity cost - growth over time greater with product - more money up front with product - more continuous money put in with contracts.
        - Which way to go? Don't choose, do both contracting and product work. 
        - Annuities - layer cake of multiple revenue streams - multiple apps making money
            - contracting is a static annuity - direct cost to revenue relationship
            - product is like a variable annuity - cost up front but variable return in the future - you are playing the long tail.
        - Play the long game
        - Annuities == assets
            - establish *hard value* of your business
            - can be leverage for financing 
            - can be used for buyouts
            - Stop thinking about revenue and acquire assets
            - Cash is king! Cash rich > IP or manpower
            - Liquidity ratio
- Conclusion
    - Stop guessing, measure
    - Mind your growth
    - Build assets
