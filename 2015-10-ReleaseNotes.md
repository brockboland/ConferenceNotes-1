### Keynote

### Flow

*By Georgia Dow* [@Georgia_Dow](https://twitter.com/Georgia_Dow)

- Use psychology to make apps even better.
- Mentions "Flow" book.
- Fully immersed in an activity - A feeling of spontaneous joy.
- Where do you find flow? When you have balanced your skill level with the task at hand.
- Too low of a challenge level can lead to boredom. Too high can lead to overwhelming feeling.
- Apps with too many features or confusing interface.
- Benefits of flow
    - Websites - more user engagement
    - Apps - feel more comfortable and intuitive
    - Jobs - with flow work longer and get sick less often.
- Criteria for flow
    - Clear goals - when we feel lost we feel incompetent
    - Intense and focused concentration in the present moment
    - A loss of self-consciousness
    - Balance between skill and challenge - Careful of the pacing of information towards the user (not too fast or slow)
    - Timelessness. Being so engrossed in the present you lose track of time.
    - Experience of the activity itself is intrinsically rewarding. "Autotelic Experience"
    - Immediate feedback
        - Slow, laggy apps can be frustrating
        - Can use sound cues, animation, responsiveness to help with this.
    - Knowing that you can succeed - Tutorials
- Testing flow in your app
    - watch people while using the app (watch their level of engagement)
    - "Flow Likert Scale"
- Things that disrupt flow in apps
    - too many choices
    - unusual interface
    - deep navigation
    - popup ads that come up in the middle of doing something
    - jarring sounds
    - lag
    - jittery movements
    - app updates with major ui changes
- Things that keep you using an application or website
    - achievement
    - productivity savings
    - feeling of enjoyment
    - new content
    - easy to consume information
- How well do *you* Flow?

### The Great Pretender

*By Pieter Omvlee* [@pieteromvlee](https://twitter.com/pieteromvlee)

- Pretend to be more than an "indie"
- Too many devs are focused on building "consumer" software
- Adopt more of a business-like approach to everything we do
- Common things to be wary of:
    - "Scratch your own itch" - valid but careful of typical crowded markets (rss readers, podcast apps)
    - "A good app will sell itself" - Millions of apps in the app store. The actual chances of this are slim.
    - "User experience is your business plan" - An actual business plan is a vital thing. User experience answers none of this.
    - "The death of indies. App Store restrictions. It's Apple's fault!" - Too simple. Apple can't be blamed for everything.
        - Slide listing issues in the App Store.
        - Don't wait for apple to fix these problems.
- We are trying to sell to the wrong market. Be more focused on serving more pro-level users.
- We are not providing enough value to customers. So can't extract enough value.
- Professional users - they have a need and they have money to spend.
- Pretend to them
    - Act with more confidence, professionalism, trustworthiness than the typical indie dev 
    - Instill confidence in customers.
    - Charge more!
    - Have a polished web site.
- Pretend to yourself - Aim Higher
    - Every day ask yourself, "What should I be doing today to increase my bottom line?" It may not involve coding!
    - Calculate the income you need per year to become indie.
    - Look at other platforms besides Apple.
    - "The first step to becoming big is to pretend to be that."

### Motivation

*By Rob Rhyne* [@capttaco](https://twitter.com/capttaco)

- "It's too hard for indies to make money on the app store"
    - No. "Should be it's hard for indies to make money"
- "People don't value software"
    - No. "People value what they can see"
    - Build a product that is compelling and provides value.
    - Marketing won't save you.
    - Pricing will not save you.
- Make decisions for yourself
    - Boyd's decision cycle
        - observation
        - orientation
        - decision
        - action
- First steps
    - collect data on what *you can measure*
    - analyze data based on *your mental* understanding
- Scientific method
    - observation
    - analysis
    - hypothesis
    - test & validate
- Science the $&%# out of your business!
    - The purpose of any business: Make Money!
    - Cash flow gives you a picture. A function of expenses and revenue. What is the cost of you revenue?
    - How do you measure cash flow?
        - Determine billing cycle - Net 30
        - Cash accounting < Accrual based accounting (based on what you invoice) - Accrual accounting is easier to understand - Only issue is end of year numbers. Reflects cost-per-dollar-earned.
    - Use Profit/Loss statements
    - Use Balance Sheet
    - If you're not growing, you are shrinking! Manage expenses!
    - How do you measure growth?
        - Lookback charts. Catch and analyze plateaued growth as soon as you can. Expenses tend to creep up in this situation.
        - Peaks and valleys. There be dragons!
            - Create a separate savings account for the business! 3-6 months operating costs. Caveat: This is not practical for a very large company.
            - Accrued revenue (you invoiced but haven't collected) - blessing and a curse.
    - Don't rely 100% on your accountant for business fundamentals.
    - Accelerants
        - build your assets - understand your margins - Contracting margins are constrained. Margins for products can be exponential. Risk matches reward for the contracting/product scenario.
        - Opportunity cost - growth over time greater with product - more money up front with product - more continuous money put in with contracts.
        - Which way to go? Don't choose, do both contracting and product work. 
        - Annuities - layer cake of multiple revenue streams - multiple apps making money
            - contracting is a static annuity - direct cost to revenue relationship
            - product is like a variable annuity - cost up front but variable return in the future - you are playing the long tail.
        - Play the long game
        - Annuities == assets
            - establish *hard value* of your business
            - can be leverage for financing 
            - can be used for buyouts
            - Stop thinking about revenue and acquire assets
            - Cash is king! Cash rich > IP or manpower
            - Liquidity ratio
- Conclusion
    - Stop guessing, measure
    - Mind your growth
    - Build assets

### Playing the Long Game

*By Chris Liscio* [@liscio](https://twitter.com/liscio)

- Expand your horizons to increase opportunities
- Attend more "parties"
- Option 1: Mass Market
- Option 2: Niche - recommended - typically under served by software
- Build tools, not toys.
- Help save the poor, rich customers!
- Pricing
    - Price carefully - avoid the race to the bottom
    - Make a cheaper *version* of your app - example: Capo touch
    - When you choose not the join the race to the bottom, you are playing in a different sport
- Revenue is oxygen
- Bank the bursts - "You get more time on the clock"
- Diversify 
    - play to your strengths 
    - Look at the Mac market (especially if building in productivity space)
- Connections
    - Attend local groups
    - Trade shows - not geared for small businesses - good time to market to a niche
    - Partnerships - form partnerships with other devs
    - Apple can help - Go to app store lab at WWDC - Contact evangelists
    - Make friends in the press, but don't overdo it!
- Staying Sane
    - Exercise! Make time for it. Stick to a long term plan.
    - Plan, plan, plan
    - Keeping pace is exhausting - Apple moves fast
    - "Retire" now - take regular mental breaks - Have hobbies
    - Your time is *yours* - say no to things
    - Forget the Joneses
    - Success is relative - What does success look like to you

### Time Management

*By Rachel Andrew* [@rachelandrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew)

- Time management- "Goals are dreams with deadlines"
- Complete things!
- Start with something small that you can *ship*.
- Making time
- Make you project a *first class citizen* - Don't treat it like a hobby.
- Try to schedule a regular shot
- Use your down time wisely - waiting for a train, airplane, commuting
- People get ahead during the time that others waste 
- Always be ready to jump into your project.
- Be careful not to to mix employer work and your own product.
- Organize tasks by *where* they can be completed or the *state of mind* you need for them: at desk, offline, to listen to, needs focus, tired
- Always be ready to work offline - Store the things you need along with the to do item
- Optimize for *your* situation - productivity tip are often situation dependent
- Optimize your environment - how quickly can you switch into your project?
- Say No to things that won't help you meet your goal.
- Beware the *entreporn* - entrepreneurial success fantasies - Focus on actionable material relevant to you
- Follow people who are good filters of information
- Saying no to family and friends
- Sharing your goal - help those you care for feel part of your progress
- A realistic schedule - helps your family see there is an end in sight
- Schedules & Lists
- You need a to do list!
    - helps stay on track
    - Start with the end goal in mind, divide it down into smaller pieces
- Break it down into sections - 6 months can be divided into 6 lists
- As you work, create two week sprints
- "I don't know how long anything will take" - accept that there will be a level of inaccuracy.
- Estimates
- A schedule helps keep motivated as you progress towards an end date - without a schedule it is easy to drift
- Most people are terrible at estimating time - we tend to be over-optimistic - we want to please the person asking
- Find out how long things really take - track actual usage against original estimate
- When the scope is overwhelming - extend the completion date, remove features
- "The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to launch." - Jason Fried
- How to manage a growing project - A product should be given more time as it represents a higher % of your income 
- Never promise a specific time frame to customers
- Collect Use Cases not Feature Requests
- Make frequent, *small* releases
- Products benefit from clarity of purpose and ownership - don't be afraid to say no
- Remember to enjoy the *journey*. Don't over fixate on the goal.
