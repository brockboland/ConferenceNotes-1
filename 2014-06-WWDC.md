# WWDC 2014 Notes

# Swift Playgrounds

- Learn swift by playing around
- interactive swift tour
- good for teaching to beginners
- useful for algo development and playing around and experimentation of apis 
- drawing code development
- processing code(fileters etc)
- keep a playground in your dock at all times!
- add value histories to the timeline
- many values have quick looks
- use resources in playgrounds - select a location for the resource path in IB (absolute, relative, inside playground)
- Experimentation - no more test projects - start a playground and write code
- Algorithm dev - 
- XCPlayground framework - XCPCaptureValue - manually capture values
- Custom quicklook for NSObject subclasses 
- Custom view development - XCPShowView - show view live as playground executes
- Asynchronous code in playground - XCPSetExecutionShouldContinueIndefinitely
- Limitations - should not be used for performance testing, use XCTest instead.
- cant be used for user interaction
- can't use custom entitlements
- only works with ios simulator
- cant use your own app or framework code
- REPL enter "repl" at breakpoint

# Intermediate Swift

## Optionals

- optional type - represents possibly missing values - default nil state
- nil is a true sentinel value that works with any type
- non-optional types - ordinary types - they CAN'T be nil
- optional return types
- unwrap optionals - forced unwrapping"!" - only use if you are sure it is not nil
- optionaly binding - test and unwrap at the same time - "if let"
- optional chaining - "?" operator check if nil before proceeding to the next expression
- combine optional binding and chaining!

## Memory Management

- built on ARC
- ownership - weak reference
- weak references are optional values - binding the optional produces a strong reference - useful for objects with independent lifetimes
- testing a weak ref does not produce a strong reference
- unowned reference - similar to unsafe_unretained - good for back references back up to their owners

## Initialization

- Every value must be initialized before it is used - Initilaziers handle this responsibility
- init keyword
- structures - memberwise initializers are automatic - can provide default values inline for stored properties 
- classes - for subclasses, set properties first, then call super - subclass properties will not get set otherwise
- initializer delegation - convenience initializers -  "convenience" keyword needs to be used
- designated go up - convenience go sideways
- initializer inheritance - not by default - set all properties to inherit
- lazy properties - @lazy keyword
- deinitialization for tearing down an object - `deinit` keyword - cleanup before deallocation

## Closures

- implicit return
- implicit arguments $ operator
- trailing closure syntax - method chaining using dot syntax
- captures - capture local state - refer to local variables and mutate them
- closures and functions are ARC objects
- ownership - "[unowned self]" inside a closure

## Pattern Matching

- Switch - "_" wildcard pattern
- type patterns - "as" pattern
- tuple patterns - "where" clause
- tests the structure of values
- improves the readablity and safety of your code

# Creating Custom iOS User Interfaces 

- When should you build custom ui? Where will this be used? Does it need to support multiple states? - Can this be shard across several apps? - What APIs can be leveraged?
- Take advantage of existing API: UIAppearance - Dynamic Type - Accessibility - Localization

## Spring Animations

- not necessarily bouncy
- different timing curve for animatitons
- don't require UIKit Dynamics
- spring begins quickly
- UIView convenience method for spring - damping: how much resistance that spring has at end, high damp means less bounce at the end - initialSpringVelocity: initial kick
- where to use them? great for linear animations - used for nearly all system animations on iOS - applies to any animatable property, not just position

## Vibrancy and Blur

- `UIVisualEffectView` - live blur - vibrancy
- `UIBlurEffect` - dark blur - light blur - ExtraLight blur
- `UIVibrancyEffect` - legible content on top of a blur - only supported with blur effect
- Tint blurs by changing background color of the content view
- setting alpha is at odds with blur
- avoid effects in a hierarchy that contains masks
- beware of animation and opacity groups
- using both blur and vib at the same time may hurt performance

## CAShapeLayers

- a great way to draw custom content
- all appearance props ar animatable
- controls with different states that need to be animated
- path property - lineCap - linedashPattern - lineDashPhase
- strokeColor - strokeBegin - strokeEnd - useful for progress control
- fillColor
- can be expensive for the CPU depending on the complexity of the path - use more layers with minimal complexity and then stacking them together in  ur view hierarchy - be cautious about frequent changes

## Dynamic Core Animation Behaviors

- override implicit animations
- disable implicit animations
- change behaviour of default animations
- define behaviors that are baked in to a custom view
- CAAction protocol - `runActionForKey` - `actionForLayer:forKey:`

# Advanced Swift - Extending the language

## Taking control of syntax

- "_" operator to make something anonymous - ex (red, _, blue, _) omit green and alpha.
- conditional cast with "if let"
- string interpolation - special protocols provided by the compiler
- overload an operator - global function - "operator infix"
- subscript declaration 
- caution - keep it natural to the language - work by analogy - new idioms should pay for themselves

## Generic programming

- function overloading - looks at the arguments
- "Any" - empty protocol type
- <placeholder for any type> - 
- generics conserve type information - great for type saftey and performance
- protocols  throw away type and are ideal for dynamic code
- type relationships - x and y can have any type at all as long as they both have the same type
- protocol constraints
- three powerful features - type deduction for concision - trailing closure syntax - generic functions
- generic types - 
- protocols are your hooks into the swift core language ex. for in 

## The Swift model

- statically compiled
- small runtime
- interaction with c and objc - other langs too
- con deploy to prev versions of ios and mac
- swift produces native code that is instantly ready to run
- no artificial abstraction barriers
- using a struct has no runtime penalty

# Advanced iOS Application Architecture and Patterns

- insight not dogma 
- why, not how

## Design Information Flow

- Where is "Truth"?
- truth vs derived values
- derived values - compute from inputs - recompute like a cache
- draw out your information flows - they need to both mean definition and invalidation
- creating new truth - the relationship needs to be assymetrical

## Define Clear responsibilities

- diagram responsbilities - who does what
- composition for validation

## Simplify with Immutability

- Why is mutability bad?
- swift structs have opt-in mutability with mutating keyword - call-by-value - new copy automatically created

* left off at motion effect

# Advanced User Interfaces with Collection Views

- implement data sources as separate objects - helps with code reuse
- use aggregate data source  - see sample code
- segmented data source for segment control
- composed data source
- data source responsible for loading
- keep track of everything with a state machine
- UICollectionViewLayout - book keeping is critical - optional methods are helpful
- swipe to edit

# Sharing code between iOS and OS X

## What code can we share

### Model

- can we share it? yes

### View

- problems with sharing view code
- interactions are different 
- display size differences 
- multiple windows on osx 
- can't compile nsview/uiview cross platform 
- shimming (#ifdef) can break builds, and hard to target fixes, also makes code hard to read, also behaviors and ui will take on the look of the original platform by default
- shimming in swift is difficult

### Controller

- depends on controller
- lots of common controller logic
- share some controllers but not all
- create common shared controller with platform specific controllers subclasses
- shared controller for dealing with rotation

## Using framworks to share

- appkit and uikit should be treated as separate objects

## Shared rendering

- core graphics and core animation
- core graphics origins are different on platforms - override `isFlipped` to be `YES` on `NSView`
- image wrapper - NSImage/UIImage adapt shared interface to platform APIs - class cluster

## File formats

- hardware differences - lazily loded model - parallelism enhancements for OSX

## How to split your code

- look at how code is used
- recognize platform differences
- consider using shared frameworks
- investigate mvc and wrappers

## Cross platform projects in Xcode

### Targets

- multiple targets
- defines a single product to build
- part of project
- libraries - contains shared code - useful when sharing between projects
- static or dynamic libraries - dynamic libs are optionally built
- xcode config files - .xcconfig - params: header serach paths, compiler warnings, architectures, sdks, deployment targets - look up the docs : xcode build setting ref - you can use inheritance with config files

# Advanced Scrollviews and Touch Handling Techniques

## hit testing

## gesture recognizers

## touch delivery

## transparent overlays

- spotlight search on springboard
- add scrollview pan gesture to view controller view
- override hitTest:withEvent: in scrollview subclass

## dragging while scrolling

- uilongpress delegate method - gestureRecognizer:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer
shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer:

## highlighting objects

- `delaysContentTouches` - touch delay gesture recognizer - `delaysTouchesBegan`
- override gesture recognizer - set a timer to fail after short interval - overide init with target action with the fail method as the action

## minimum hit target size

- cgrectinset with neg value to expand bounds

# A strategy for great work: stories and the lessons learned from them - Ken Kocienda

## Trying to do great work

## Strategic ideas

- strategy begets tactics

### 11 lessons

1. Like a crystal ball - know a good idea when you see it - make domos and prototypes! don't be afraid to look like an idiot. get it working

2. The Block Obilisk - Don't try to solve every problem at once - figure out what the most important thing to do first

3. The Hardest Problem - find smart friends and listen to them - abstractions organized work - don't stay blocked

4. QWERTY - Work should explain itself - people already know how to use qwerty keyboard 

5. Every work on every keystroke - choose the simplest thing that might work - simple is often speedy

6. We only need one of these, right? - Only show your best work - don't show people your second-best work

7. Let's Try it 2% darker - Iterating quickly leads to better work

8. Rewrite - Three lessons from making this session - three full rehearsals of this session and a complete rewrite.

9. be kind to people, but be honest about the work

10. Separate yourself from your work.

11. You're never done - keep improving on your work - the stories and lessons never end.
